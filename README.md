# AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Submitted by: **Ray Simbiri**

Time spent: **9** hours spent in total

## Summary

What if lions needed an app to order food? **Simba Restaraunt** is an imaginary android app that dives into such an imaginary virtual restaraunt.  With the Savannah's main customer being Simba, he is definitely spoilt for choice!

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ü¶Åüëëüçñ**
